    autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
    autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.
    public: true       # Allows optimizing the container by removing unused services; this also means
    # fetching services directly from the container via $container->get() won't work.
    # The best practice is to be explicit about your dependencies anyway.
